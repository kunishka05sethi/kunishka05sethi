👋 Hi, I’m Kunishka!
👀 I love diving into challenges—problems are just adventures in disguise!- some call it curiosity, I call it "plot development".
🌱 Currently on a quest of self-discovery, embracing every experience, finding beauty in everything, and cherishing every moment with my loved ones.
💞️ I’m always excited to collaborate on creative, meaningful, and thought-provoking projects, bonus points if food is involved... 
📫 You can reach me through the stars… or maybe just drop me a message! 😉
😄 Pronouns: She/Her
⚡ Fun fact: I’m basically a walking contradiction—I crave adventure but love the comfort of home, I’m a foodie who can never decide on what to eat, and I’m a free spirit who thrives on deep connections. Whether I’m exploring new places, learning about different cultures, or just having deep late-night talks, I’m all about making life an unforgettable experience.Freedom fuels me, and if you try to box me in… well, good luck catching me because I’m already off on my next adventure!
